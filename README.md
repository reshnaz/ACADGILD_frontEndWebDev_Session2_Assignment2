--------------------------------------------------------
The html to be previewed is constructor.html and the JS file it uses is constructor.js (which is compiled form constructor.ts).

Problem Statement

1. Create a class and add a constructor to it which will take two values a string and a
number.

2. Class should have to private member and that member should get value assigned
through constructor

3. The class should have one function which will return the message with the string
and value which is passed to the constructor.

4. The return message string should be created by using backtick/backquote and
embedded expressions then create constructor.html, add compiled file into this
HTML like(constructor.js). The output should display as string and number
message.

5. DO remember to annotate with proper datatype the parameters and function
